# FdF (wireframe viewer) 

## üí° About the project

The FdF-42-macOS project provides a graphical representation of a landscape, where the terrain is outlined with lines to emphasize the topography and surface details. The result is a visually appealing 3D model that helps in understanding and analyzing the landscape's features.

## üñºÔ∏è Screenshots

Here are some examples of the rendered 3D landscapes:
